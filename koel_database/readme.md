This directory contains **Koel Database** based on the [Koel template from drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/templates/koel).  

I customized the schema to create a database design that showcases:  
- Table structures and relationships  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Basic SQL queries  
- Advanced SQL features (joins, aggregations, triggers, etc.)
